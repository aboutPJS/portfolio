          As a Master of Service Design, I specialise in orchestrating the design process for (digital) services, 
          using a systemic approach that goes beyond mere visual aesthetics. 
          For me, service design is about sculpting a user journey that is delightful from start to finish, 
          meticulously crafting every touchpoint where users interact with the service.
    
          Effective service design doesn't occur in isolation; it's a collaborative effort with users and stakeholders. 
          Maintaining a systemic overview and considering multiple perspectives during conceptualization are paramount. 
          Ultimately, successful services are grounded in user insights and undergo multiple iterations of prototyping.
             
          For me, incorporating business considerations into service design is essential. 
          I ensure that services are user-centric, but also monetisable and financially viable. 
          My expertise extends to presenting and advocating services to decision makers, 
          facilitating alignment between design and business objectives.
          
          My understanding of the intricacies of IT plays a key role in designing digital service. 
          I am adept at identifying technical feasibility and working effectively with system experts to seamlessly integrate technological solutions. 
          Identifying and exploiting technical touchpoints, estimating resource requirements and optimising data usage are integral parts of my approach, 
          ensuring that services are not only innovative but also technically robust.
          
          In essence, my diverse skill set enables me to create services that resonate with users, align with business objectives, 
          and harness the power of technology to deliver exceptional experiences users love.

        When it comes to UX & UI design, my expertise extends beyond the creation of visually appealing interfaces. 
        With a solid foundation in user experience principles, I bring a wealth of experience to the table.
        I emphasise the prototyping of designs, allowing for efficient iteration and refinement of user interfaces. 
        Through rigorous testing processes, I ensure that designs meet user needs and expectations, delivering intuitive and seamless experiences.
        My skills in organising Figma files streamline collaboration with developers. 
        By structuring files so that developers can easily navigate and extract styles, I facilitate smooth design handoffs and implementation.
        From my experience as a front-end developer, I understand the importance of pattern libraries and design systems. 
        Leveraging these resources promotes a high level of reusability and reduces resource consumption during application development. By implementing standardised design components, I promote consistency and efficiency across projects.
        In summary, my UX & UI design skills encompass prototyping, 
        figma organisation and testing methodologies, enriched with insights from front-end development. 
        This holistic approach ensures that designs not only look great, but also work seamlessly and efficiently.
