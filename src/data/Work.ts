        description: `
        Whiteboard-based tools such as Miro and FigJam are widely
used by service designers to document their processes. While valued for
their collaborative and visual strengths, these tools often result in frag-
mented, inconsistent, and difficult-to-retrieve documentation. This thesis
investigates how documentation practices in service design might be im-
proved by introducing intelligent, AI-powered retrieval systems.
The research sets out two objectives: (1) to enable service designers to
document their work in a way that large language models (LLMs) can
process effectively, and (2) to apply an LLM to support natural language
querying of that documentation. Following a Research through Design
approach, the study combines user research (survey, workshop, inter-
view), scenario-based design, and trend analysis to understand current
practices and explore future directions. These insights informed the de-
velopment of a proof of concept framework, FLUID, which was evaluated
through a limited user test.
Key findings highlight the fragmented and unsustainable nature of cur-
rent documentation ecosystems, a strong recognition of pain points among
designers, and a general openness to change. The test demonstrated the
technical feasibility of AI-enhanced documentation but also revealed us-
ability and onboarding challenges.
The thesis concludes that while structured input is essential for effect-
ive LLM-powered retrieval, tools like FLUID must align with design-
ers’ realities to gain traction. It also emphasizes the need for accessible
onboarding and reflects on the trade-off between offering FLUID as a
simplified service and using it to foster technical literacy among service
designers. Ultimately, the work positions intelligent documentation not
only as a technical upgrade but as an opportunity to empower designers
in an AI-driven future.

        During my Master's studies at Aalborg University, my group and I are engaged in a project commissioned by IKEA. Our challenge is to "Create a better financial everyday for the modern lives of the many people."

To address this challenge, we have been working on several fronts. Firstly, we've developed future scenarios within the realm of finance. Additionally, we've conducted extensive research to identify existing financial services. Moreover, we've organized co-creation workshops aimed at gaining insights into the financial needs and challenges faced by individuals in various aspects of their lives.

Our project is currently ongoing, and we will continue to update this post with our progress.

        During a transition in Product Owners, 
        I had the opportunity to spearhead the conceptualization of a significant redesign for sections of the sourcing application within the AVIATAR platform. 
        This involved conducting user interviews with key stakeholders to gain insights into their workflows and software expectations. 
        Collaborating closely with the UX Department of AVIATAR, we co-created a new concept for a crucial aspect of the application.
        Given the time-sensitive nature of the conceptualization phase, 
        my familiarity with the application's architecture allowed me to swiftly evaluate data feasibility and availability, 
        ensuring rapid subsequent development.
        Following the initial concept creation, I assumed responsibility for orchestrating seamless development. 
        I crafted appropriately sized user stories, leveraging my technical expertise to streamline the process. 
        Subsequently, I monitored progress, contributed, and coordinated development efforts.
        As a result of these efforts, the redesign—from initial ideation to delivery—was accomplished within just two sprints. 
        This overhaul not only enhanced user efficiency but also bolstered application performance.

        I collaborated with Lufthansa Technik on my Bachelor thesis, 
        focusing on "Agent-based generation of artificial data to enhance customer-centricity in the sales process".
        While the title may seem technical, the motivation behind it is quite straightforward: 
        placing the user at the forefront. 
        For software companies, providing demo applications to potential customers allows them to test and experience the application firsthand. 
        However, in the B2B context where software interacts with customer data, 
        questions arise about which databases the demonstration should operate on when no customer data is available. 
        Utilizing data from other customers is not feasible, and manually keeping data current and engaging is impractical, 
        particularly for large datasets.
        To address this challenge and offer customers the opportunity to test the application, 
        I researched methods for continuously generating such datasets, ultimately aimed at enhancing the sales process.
