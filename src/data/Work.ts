        During my Master's studies at Aalborg University, my group and I are engaged in a project commissioned by IKEA. Our challenge is to "Create a better financial everyday for the modern lives of the many people."

To address this challenge, we have been working on several fronts. Firstly, we've developed future scenarios within the realm of finance. Additionally, we've conducted extensive research to identify existing financial services. Moreover, we've organized co-creation workshops aimed at gaining insights into the financial needs and challenges faced by individuals in various aspects of their lives.

Our project is currently ongoing, and we will continue to update this post with our progress.

        During a transition in Product Owners, 
        I had the opportunity to spearhead the conceptualization of a significant redesign for sections of the sourcing application within the AVIATAR platform. 
        This involved conducting user interviews with key stakeholders to gain insights into their workflows and software expectations. 
        Collaborating closely with the UX Department of AVIATAR, we co-created a new concept for a crucial aspect of the application.
        Given the time-sensitive nature of the conceptualization phase, 
        my familiarity with the application's architecture allowed me to swiftly evaluate data feasibility and availability, 
        ensuring rapid subsequent development.
        Following the initial concept creation, I assumed responsibility for orchestrating seamless development. 
        I crafted appropriately sized user stories, leveraging my technical expertise to streamline the process. 
        Subsequently, I monitored progress, contributed, and coordinated development efforts.
        As a result of these efforts, the redesign—from initial ideation to delivery—was accomplished within just two sprints. 
        This overhaul not only enhanced user efficiency but also bolstered application performance.

      My ability to bridge the gap between business requirements and development proved instrumental in these interactions.
      As a result, I was given more responsibility, including writing user stories with the Product Owner and 
      coordinating the development of new features with internal and external colleagues.

        I collaborated with Lufthansa Technik on my Bachelor thesis, 
        focusing on "Agent-based generation of artificial data to enhance customer-centricity in the sales process".
        While the title may seem technical, the motivation behind it is quite straightforward: 
        placing the user at the forefront. 
        For software companies, providing demo applications to potential customers allows them to test and experience the application firsthand. 
        However, in the B2B context where software interacts with customer data, 
        questions arise about which databases the demonstration should operate on when no customer data is available. 
        Utilizing data from other customers is not feasible, and manually keeping data current and engaging is impractical, 
        particularly for large datasets.
        To address this challenge and offer customers the opportunity to test the application, 
        I researched methods for continuously generating such datasets, ultimately aimed at enhancing the sales process.
