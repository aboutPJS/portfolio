While valued for\ntheir collaborative and visual strengths, these tools often result in frag-\nmented, inconsistent, and difficult-to-retrieve documentation. This thesis\ninvestigates how documentation practices in service design might be im-\nproved by introducing intelligent, AI-powered retrieval systems.\nThe research sets out two objectives: (1) to enable service designers to\ndocument their work in a way that large language models (LLMs) can\nprocess effectively, and (2) to apply an LLM to support natural language\nquerying of that documentation. Following a Research through Design\napproach, the study combines user research (survey, workshop, inter-\nview), scenario-based design, and trend analysis to understand current\npractices and explore future directions. These insights informed the de-\nvelopment of a proof of concept framework, FLUID, which was evaluated\nthrough a limited user test.\nKey findings highlight the fragmented and unsustainable nature of cur-\nrent documentation ecosystems, a strong recognition of pain points among\ndesigners, and a general openness to change. The test demonstrated the\ntechnical feasibility of AI-enhanced documentation but also revealed us-\nability and onboarding challenges.\nThe thesis concludes that while structured input is essential for effect-\nive LLM-powered retrieval, tools like FLUID must align with design-\nersâ€™ realities to gain traction. It also emphasizes the need for accessible\nonboarding and reflects on the trade-off between offering FLUID as a\nsimplified service and using it to foster technical literacy among service\ndesigners.

expectations. \n        Collaborating closely with the UX Department of AVIATAR, we co-created a new concept for a crucial aspect of the application.\n        Given the time-sensitive nature of the conceptualization phase, \n        my familiarity with the application\'s architecture allowed me to swiftly evaluate data feasibility and availability, \n        ensuring rapid subsequent development.\n        Following the initial concept creation, I assumed responsibility for orchestrating seamless development. \n        I crafted appropriately sized user stories, leveraging my technical expertise to streamline the process. \n        Subsequently, I monitored progress, contributed, and coordinated development efforts.\n        As a result of these efforts, the redesignâ€”from initial ideation to deliveryâ€”was accomplished within just two sprints. \n        This overhaul not only enhanced user efficiency but also bolstered application performance.\n  \n
